- **C++**: Programming Language used for programming Aurdino Uno
- **Thinker Cad platform**: ThinkerCad is Open source platform where Electronic components can visualize.

### Key Insights
- In this Task, Tools used:
- - Aurdino UNO R3
  - Breadboard
  - LED
  - 220 ohms Resistor
  - Connecting wires
- Audino UNO R3 board is dumped with Code given in Repository in Thinkercad platform.
- Tools are connected as shown in the figure above
- Code dumped in Aurdino UNO R3 makes the RGB LED to blink
  - RED colour for 1000 milliseconds and turn off after 1000 milliseconds
  - GREEN colour for 1000 milliseconds and turn off after 1000 milliseconds
  - BLUE colour for 1000 milliseconds and turn off after 1000 milliseconds
